            <h2>The First Day</h2>
            <p>We first landed on the beautiful island of Maui at 3 pm.  It gave us 
                    enough time to grocery shop and head to the condo which we would 
                    call home for the next 10 days.  Here is a cool website all about Maui.

            <h2>The Second Day</h2>
            <p>The view from our condo in Kihei was amazing.  It faced the ocean and had sky 
                for days.  Today was the day that we explored the north-west side of the island.
                We went to Lahanina and drove up toward Kapalua.  The road started getting really
                interesting so we stopped and enjoyed the view.

            <h2>The Third Day</h2>
            <p>Today was the day we drove to Hana.  Interesting fact, when you rent a car on
                Maui there is a warning to not drive a certain side of the island.  When travelling
                to Hana the road is curvy, narrow, and scary at times.  We came up with an alternate plan
                We took our rental car on the side of the island that was forbidden, shhhhh, don't tell.
                We went the backway into Hana.  We enjoyed seeing the dry side of the island.  The highlights 
                of the day was the beaches.  The red, black, and tan sand beaches.

            <h2>The Fourth Day</h2>
            <p>Well look at that sunset.  It was the first time we enjoyed the sunset from the roof of
                our condo complex.  We were told if all the conditions are just right there is a burst of
                green light just as the sun sets on the horizen.  There are also a couple of people who own
                in the complex that come to the roof everynight and blow their conch shells, signifing the
                end of the day.  What another great day in paradise.

            <h2>The Fifth Day</h2>
            <p>The day of beaches is what I called today.  We wanted to see all of the beaches that we
                had been reading about before we came to Maui.  We hopped into the car and visited at least
                six beaches.  My husband loves to snorkle and he wanted to see fish. He saw the starte
                fish of Hawaii called humuhumunkununukapua'a.  We also saw whales from the shore on 
                Big Beach.  We could see them breaching and playing.  It was something I have always
                wanted to see.

            <h2>The Sixth Day</h2>
            <p>Are you excited to go and visit Maui yet?  I am already ready to go back.  From this
                point on we just hung out at the favorite beaches that we had visited.  It was a good day
                if we sat/swim on the beach and had great food.

            <h2>The Seventh Day</h2>
            <p>Another wonderful day in paradise.  This was about the time that we were dreading having
                to return home so soon.  We could have stayed forever!  We would have if our kids were
                not on the mainland waiting for us.  A rainbow in Kihei looks magicial.

            <h2>The Eighth Day</h2>
            <p>The time of year we were on Maui we knew that it was whale season and turtle season
                as well.  So we were on the look out for them.  We had seen a couple from the beach
                as they swam by.  By the time we could get our snorkle gear we could find them again.
                Today we found them right outside our condo.  There was a man-made reef that they constructed
                to create shallow, calm area for families.  Along this rock reef were turtle basking in
                the sun.  From a distance they looked like other rocks.  Glad we saw them so close up.

            <p>Another day of being beach bums and eating great food.  It can't get any better than this.
                Great company, great food at a great place.

            <h2>The Tenth Day</h2>
            <p>The day we had been dreading has arrived.  We had to leave this tropical paradise
                for a hard dose of reality.  It was the best vacation so far that we have enjoyed.  
                Our last meal on Maui was a local italian joint. We vow to return soon.  
                Until then Aloha!

            <h2>The Snow</h2>
            <p>We took a red eye from Hawaii and returned on a beautiful Saturday morning.  WAIT, nope
                it was a snow armagedden.  It was a shock to our system.  It made us want to return 
                so much sooner to paradise.
